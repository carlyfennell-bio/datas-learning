    "My husband and I have lived in Vancouver for the past 5 years. I work for a startup company and he works for the city of Port Coquitlam as an arborist.  We have recently had a son and would like to consider moving to an area in BC that is more affordable where our son would be able to interact with nature more frequently on our property.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We are also extremely interested in starting up a business with friends to run an organic farm and set up a brewery.  Our friends have 2 years experience running their own organic plot on an acre of land and a number of years working for the UBC farm prior to that. Collectively we have 0 experience in brewing but we have some great business experience to rely on and are all hard workers. The issue is, determining the location to live in to set up these businesses is extremely critical and could be the difference between success and failure. We would need land that is appropriate for farming, and ideally would give us access to a long growing season.  As for a brewery, off the top of my head we would need a population that would support it AND we would not want to be competing with other breweries in the area. Most practically, we need to be able to afford purchasing a piece of land that would support these endeavers. Lastly, lifestyle is extremely important to us and we would like to have access to many outdoor activities but most importantly excellent hiking trails.\n",

    "It would be very helpful to get a list of cities where a farming/brewery business would be opportunistic alongside reasonable realestate prices.  "
